sophomorix4 is the next generation sophomorix
This file is relevant only IF THERE IS A REWRITE of sophomorix

Consider this:
------------------------------------------------------------
- Usig ldap instead of postgres
  (Avoid)
- Use Python (or other) instead of perl
  + no need to upgrade to perl 6
  + python 3 is new and popular
  - rewrite, 
  - Python lerning

What leads towards a rewrite (instead of fixing old code)
------------------------------------------------------------
- change from Perl to Python (or other)
- no need to remove bind-mount code in sophomorix2
- no need to remove goups-of-groups-code in sophomorix2
  use function in the end that fixes everything
- add multiple schools support (better to do this from scratch)
  - create students group
  - create group school1, group school2 
- use english througout (variable names, comments, ...)
- create a library to access/add/remove data from ldap
  - to be used from schulkonsole, ...
- integrate /etc/linuxmuster/workstation into ldap
  - sync to ldap
  - create accounts
  - import workstations/linbo?/??? accesses workstation data in ldap
- integrate leoclient2 into ldap ???
- migrate sophomorix.conf to utf8



What can/should be done in sophomorix4:
------------------------------------------------------------
- autodetect encoding with a Database of names
- log schueler.txt, ... automatically (if they differ)
- make the scripts much less noisy
  - do not print out much, keep it in a complex datastructure)
  - dump the datastructure when -v is given
- differ between utf8-name (displayname) and ascii-name ()
